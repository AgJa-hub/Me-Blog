            <h2>Education</h2>
            <h3>Adventist University of the Philippines</h3>
            <h4>BS of Information Technology (2019 - now)</h4>
            <p>
                I am doing a degree in Infromation Technology, learning a lot
                of things each new semester. Even though the classes are online 
                and it is a bit hard to learn by myself without seeing the professor 
                face to face, I am still glad of the progress I am making and everything 
                I've learned so far.
            </p>
            <h3>Governemental High School of Lome</h3>
            <h4>Major in Biiology and Chemestry (2012 - 2019)</h4>
            <p>
                contrarly to the Philippines, in Togo we have 7 years of highschool. <br />
                at the 5<sup>th</sup> class you can choose the major you want to specialize on 
                and I choose Biology and Chemestry. It was quite difficile because you have to 
                do mathemeatics and physics in plus but I am graduated from Highschool with 
                honor.
